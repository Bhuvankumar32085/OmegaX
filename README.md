## 🎥 Video Calling Technology

OmegaX uses **ZEGOCLOUD** for video calling functionality.

⚠️ **Important Notice:**
- The video calling service is currently using **ZEGOCLOUD Free Plan**
- ⏳ **Free plan will expire after 10 days**
- After expiry, **video calling may stop working** unless the plan is upgraded
